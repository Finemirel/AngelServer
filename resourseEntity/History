1 January 2021 year

	I decide decision to day for study full stack technologies by Java write web application
for search and rescue squad “Angel” (SAR “Angel”)  from Belarus. 
	I am a volunteer in the SAR “Angel” since 2013 year. Many tasks take a very long time.
Some of them can be solved with the necessary software, and some automate up to one click
on the necessary button in it.
	I will be recording here to promote the writing of the web application. I do it for history 
and English learning.
